The goal of this project is to equip developers with the knowledge and skills to efficiently use Sass and SCSS, powerful extensions of CSS, to streamline and enhance the front-end development process. By the end of the project, participants should be able to explain key concepts and effectively implement Sass/SCSS in their web development projects without relying on external resources.
